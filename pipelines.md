# Script your own weasel pipeline

To script your own `weasel` pipelines, you need to have Python installed, then follow the installation instructions below to install `weasel`.

Once installed, the best way to start is by first going through the tutorials on scripting pipelines with toy applications. 

Then pick one of your own Python functions that you would like to wrap into `weasel`. Best start simple - an image filter perhaps, or simple image transformation. Then go to the weasel pipeline store, select a pipeline that does something similar, save it under a different name and modify it for your needs. If you are looking for specific functions - check the **weasel scripting reference manual**.

# Installation instructions

# The weasel pipeline store

Weasel pipelines can be distributed independently via the **pipeline store**, which includes free pipelines including demo's provided by the `weasel` developers and any uploaded by the community. 

The terms and conditions of distribution are set by the owner of the pipeline and some may choose to add restrictions to use or redistribution. 

We encourage developers of new pipelines to post these on the pipeline store to enhance visibility of their work and add to the community of `weasel` users, but this is not required.
