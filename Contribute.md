# How can I contribute to the weasel website?

The `weasel` website is a [GitHub Page](https://github.com/QIB-Sheffield/weaselweb) in the specific Layout "Just-the-docs".

You can find a quick guide below on how to write .md files for site construction. There is very good documentation on "Just-the-docs" at https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/
Also, have a look at the files on Github at https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs

### GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/QIB-Sheffield/weaselweb/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

The weasel Pages site uses the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme that was selected in the [repository settings](https://github.com/QIB-Sheffield/weaselweb/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
