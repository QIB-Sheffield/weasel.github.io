# Getting started with weasel wrappers

If you want to try out an existing `weasel` wrapper, simply select a **weasel demo wrapper** from the **wrap store**, download and double-click to start. The interface should be fairly selfexplanatory. If you are looking for some tips and tricks - please check out the tutorials below.

_You will need some DICOM data to try `weasel`. If you do not have any, you can download some from the library of data samples provided [TBD], or download a freely available dataset such as [RIDER](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/RIDER+Collections)._

# Wrap store

Weasel wrappers can be distributed via the **wrap store**, which includes free wrappers including demo wrappers provided by the `weasel` developers and any uploaded by the community. 

The terms and conditions of distribution are set by the owner of the wrapper and some may choose to add restrictions to use or redistribution. 

We encourage developers of new wrappers to post these on the wrap store to enhance visibility of their work and add to the community of `weasel` users, but this is not required.
