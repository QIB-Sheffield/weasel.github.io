# What is Weasel?

**`weasel` is a Python environment for developing and deploying quantitative medical imaging applications.** 

`weasel` aims to simplify the process of testing prototype image processing pipelines on clinical data, by avoiding the need for dedicated graphical interface development and removing the overhead involved in interfacing with DICOM databases. This will speed up the translation of new methods into early stage clinical studies, bringing forward the point where prototypes can be stress-tested under real world conditions.

`weasel` is for you if:

- You are developing methods for processing of medical images, and you want to test these on clinical data, to visualise the results, or to integrate them in clinical studies. 

`weasel` will offer you an easy way to wrap your algorithms into a platform that integrates seamlessly with DICOM databases (read and write), and includes graphical interfaces for visualising multi-dimensional imaging data, defining regions of interest, or extracting quantitative data. 

If you want to share your methods with the wider community, you can integrate `weasel` wrappers into the distribution of your code, allowing clinical users to run your methods on their clinical data through the built-in graphical interface. 

- You run clinical studies involving medical imaging and are looking to integrate quantitative endpoints that are not available as commercial tools or as plugins for standard DICOM image viewers.

`weasel` provides your collaborators that develop new methods and easy way to package them up in a `weasel` wrapper for use by an image analyst or clinical user through a graphical interface including a basic DICOM viewer. 

Alternatively, you can browse the _weasel_ pipeline library and customize a `weasel` wrapper to fit the needs of your study. This will also promote reproducible science by providing a means for others to verify your results independently.
