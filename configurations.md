# Build your own weasel configuration

To build your own `weasel` configuration, you need to have Python installed, then follow the installation instructions below to install `weasel`.

Once installed, follow these steps:

1. Go to the library of weasel configurations and open up _demo-configuration.xml_.
2. Save the file as _my-weasel-configuration.xml_ in the library. 
3. Open up the file _config.xml_ in your `weasel` distribution.
4. Replace _Menus.xml_ by _my-weasel-configuration.xml_. 
5. Now run `weasel.py` in your favourite Python development environment.

If you want to add new menus or submenus to your configuration, simply open up _my-weasel-configuration.xml_ and add menu items from the **library of weasel pipelines**.
