# Getting started with weasel apps

If you want to try out an existing `weasel` app, simply select a **weasel demo app** from the **app store**, download and double-click to start. The interface should be fairly selfexplanatory. If you are looking for some tips and tricks - please check out the tutorials below.

_You will need some DICOM data to try `weasel`. If you do not have any, you can download some from the library of data samples provided [TBD], or download a freely available dataset such as [RIDER](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/RIDER+Collections)._

# Weasel app store

Weasel apps can be distributed via the **app store**, which includes free apps including demo apps provided by the `weasel` developers and any uploaded by the community. 

The terms and conditions of distribution are set by the owner of the app and some may choose to add restrictions to use or redistribution. 

We encourage developers of new apps to post these on the app store to enhance visibility of their work and add to the community of `weasel` users, but this is not required.
